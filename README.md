This is my Portfolio website. I chose webpack as my bundler of choice due to webpack's excellent configuration options.
Three.js is used to create the 3d environment that serves as the background for my app. I chose to create a space theme for my portfolio due to my love of space and sci-fi.
The intersection observer api was used to run animations when a user scrolls to a specific part of the page which then fires a function that runs the animation.
I used OBS Studio to create an mp4 video for my project section to showcase that project. I had to use Adobe Premier pro to trim the video as well as encode the video in H.264
so that my video would run inside the "video" html tag
